# Elementary Math

Given the set of all pairs $E$ and the set of all operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication) results $R$, construct a bipartite graph. In this graph, each value from $E$ and $R$ are the nodes. Specifically, there must be a mapping from $E$ to $R$ such that each $e∈E$ maps to only one $r∈R$, and vice versa.
